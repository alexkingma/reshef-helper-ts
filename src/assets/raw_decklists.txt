3	Ooguchi
1	Key Mace
3	Steel Scorpion
3	Ameba
3	Bat
3	Zone Eater
1	Ancient Jar

Tristan's monsters have 500 ATK or less, so he should be easy to defeat.  He
uses varied Summons, though, so he could destroy a few of your monsters if gets
lucky.

===============================================================================
			4.02 - Yugi Muto

Monsters:
---------
1	Gaia the Dragon Champion

Yugi uses varied Summons (Wind, Fiend, Forest, Earth and Dark).  Aside from
Mushroom Man and Exodia the Forbidden One, his non-tribute monsters have 500
ATK or less.

Yugi's strongest tribute monsters are Summoned Skull and Dark Magician.  Make
sure you have a few monster destruction cards ready in case he manages to
summon them.

===============================================================================
			4.03 - Joey Wheeler
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Battle Warrior
3	Kagemusha of the Blue Flame
1	Baby Dragon
3	Jinzo #7
3	Time Wizard
3	The Unhappy Maiden
3	Mountain Warrior

1	Red-Eyes Black Dragon
3	Queen's Double

Magic:
------
1	Kunai with Chain
1	Salamandra

Traps:
------
1	Eatgaboon

Like Yugi, Joey uses varied Summons (Earth, Fire, Fiend, Dream, Light, Dark and
Forest).  Aside from Baby Dragon, his non-tribute monsters have 700 ATK
or less.  Half of them are Warrior-Type, so you can use Warrior Elimination to
destroy them.

===============================================================================
			4.04 - Rebecca
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Blast Juggler
1	Witch of the Black Forest
2	Vishwar Randi
1	Cannon Soldier
1	Sangan
3	Water Element
3	Mega Thunderball
3	Prisman
3	Mystical Sheep #1
3	Djinn the Watcher of the Wind
3	Alinsection
3	Muse-A
1	Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon
1	Millennium Shield
1	Fiend's Hand
1	Shadow Ghoul

Magic:
------
1	Mooyan Curry
1	Megamorph
1	Monster Reborn
1	Spellbinding Circle
1	Dark-Piercing Light

Traps:
------
1	Bear Trap
1	Fake Trap

Rebecca uses varied Summons (Fiend, Dark, Thunder, Water, Fire, Light, Wind and
Forest).  Aside from Cannon Soldier and Witch of the Black Forest, Rebecca's
non-tribute monsters have 600-1000 ATK.  Her strongest non-tribute monsters are
Cannon Soldier, Witch of the Black Forest and Mystical Sheep #1.  Have a few
monster destruction cards ready in case they are summoned.

The one monster to be wary of is Millennium Shield.  It is Rebecca's strongest
defensive monster, and she only has to sacrifice 1 monster to summon it.  Since
it has 0 ATK, I suggest using Stop Defense to switch it to attack mode, thus
allowing you to destroy it.

===============================================================================
				4.05 - Roland
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
1	Doron
1	Little Chimera
1	Milus Radius
1	Sinister Serpent
1	Mask of Darkness
1	Abyss Flower
1	Muka Muka
1	Dharma Cannon
1	Morphing Jar
1	Frog the Jam
1	Penguin Soldier
1	Pot the Trick
1	The Last Warrior from Another Planet
3	Black Luster Soldier
3	Master of Dragon Soldier
1	Bolt Escargot
1	Saber Slasher
1	Witch's Apprentice
3	Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon
1	Gale Dogra
1	Queen's Double
1	White Dolphin
1	Mechaleon
1	Griggle
1	Zone Eater
1	Bone Mouse
1	Hiro's Shadow Scout
1	The Unhappy Maiden

Magic:
------
1	Pot of Greed

Traps:
------
1	House of Adhesive Tape

Roland uses varied Summons (Fiend, Water, Thunder, Forest, Dark, Earth and
Wind).  He also has a few Divine monsters in his deck.  His non-tribute
monsters have 900 ATK or less.  He will use the multiplying special
abilities of Dorons to gather enough monsters to summon Black Luster Soldier,
Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon or Master of Dragon Soldier, so I advice using
Thunder-Summon monsters to destroy them via Summon advantage.  It would
be advantageous to place a Dragon Capture Jar on the field to stop the two
latter Divine monsters from attacking.  Roland won't have a chance to summon
them if you can prevent him from ever having 3 monsters to sacrifice.

===============================================================================
			4.06 - Mokuba
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Blue-Eyed Silver Zombie
3	Man-Eating Plant
3	Skelengel
3	Monster Eye
3	Jinzo #7
3	Krokodilus
3	Mechanical Spider
3	Mystic Lamp
3	Leghul
3	Bat
1	Witch's Apprentice

Magic:
------
3	Darkness Approaches
2	Mooyan Curry

Traps:
------
3	House of Adhesive Tape

Like Roland, Mokuba uses varied Summons (Fiend, Dark, Light, Water and Forest).
His non-tribute monsters have 1100 ATK or less.  Mystic Lamp and Leghul can
both attack your LP directly, but they have a low ATK, so they're not that bad.
Skelengel allows Mokuba to draw 1 card from his deck.

Be wary of Monster Eye, as it allows Mokuba to look at the cards in your hand
and change them to face-up position.  If you're holding any Effect Monsters
with temporary effects, you won't be able to activate them unless you play
Darkness Approaches.

Mokuba will play Darkness Approaches himself to switch his Effect Monsters from
face-up to face-down position, so he can activate their effects once again.
Another monster to be wary of is Witch's Apprentice.  It powers up Dark
monsters and powers down Light monsters on the field.

===============================================================================
			4.07  - Puppeteer of Doom
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Megirus Light
3	Wicked Dragon with the Ersatz Head
3	Phantom Dewan
3	Two-Mouth Darkruler
3	Blue-Eyed Silver Zombie
3	Needle Ball
3	Vishwar Randi
3	Gate Deeg
2	Doll of Demise
2	Ansatsu
2	Giant-Mech Soldier
2	The Last Warrior from Another Planet

Magic:
------
2	Malevolent Nuzzler
2	Final Flame
2	Yami

Traps:
------
2	Eatgaboon

Puppeteer's non-tribute monsters have 700-900 ATK and his Fiend-Types can take
advantage of the Yami field.  He specialises in using Fiend, Dark and Forest
monsters.  Doll of Demise is his only Forest monster, so if you can destroy all
3 copies of it, you can then concentrate on using Light and Dream monsters to
destroy his Fiend and Dark monsters.

===============================================================================
				4.08 - Lector
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Patrol Robo
3	Prisman
3	Cyber Jar
3	Blast Juggler
3	White Magical Hat
3	Necrolancer the Timelord
3	Electric Snake
3	Turtle Racoon
3	Injection Fairy Lily
1	Jinzo
1	Crow Goblin
1	Psycho Puppet
3	Hiro's Shadow Scout

Magic:
------
1	Sparks
3	Mooyan Curry
1	Hinotama
1	Machine Conversion Factory
1	Heavy Storm

Lector's non-tribute monsters have 1200 ATK or less.  The one monster to be
wary of is Jinzo.  It destroys all your traps, and Lector only has to sacrifice
1 monster to summon it.

===============================================================================
				4.09 - Johnny Steps
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
1	Water Omotics
3	Karate Man
2	Lady of Faith
3	Arlownay
3	Muse-A
3	Goddess of Whim
3	Prisman
3	Sonic Maid
3	Rose Spectre of Dunn
3	Musician King
2	Witch of the Black Forest
3	Vishwar Randi
1	Spirit of the Harp

Magic:
------
3	Metalmorph

Traps:
------
1	Goblin Fan
1	Bear Trap
1	Reverse Trap
1	Bad Reaction to Simochi

Johnny's non-tribute monsters have 1400 ATK or less.  The monster to be wary of
is Spirit of the Harp.  It has 2000 DEF and is Johnny's strongest defensive
monster.

===============================================================================
				4.10 - Crump
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Kappa Avenger
3	Doron
3	Toad Master
3	Penguin Soldier
3	Akihiron
3	Bolt Penguin
3	Flying Penguin
3	Twin Long Rods #1
3	Penguin Torpedo
3	Penguin Knight
3	Octoberser
1	Nightmare Penguin

Magic:
------
3	Umi
3	Power of Kaishin

Crump's non-tribute monsters have 1200 ATK or less.  He specialises in using
Aqua and Thunder-Summon monsters, so I suggest using Thunder and
Earth monsters to destroy them.  Crump will use his field Magic Card to change
the playing field to Umi to benefit his own monsters.

Nightmare Penguin powers up his monsters (including itself), and he only has to
sacrifice 1 monster to summon it.  Have a Beckon to Darkness ready to destroy
it.  If Crump has changed the field to the Umi type, Nightmare Penguin will
become his strongest monster.  He will use the multiplying abilities of Toad
Masters and Dorons as tribute fodder, so I advice taking them out with
Thunder monsters.

===============================================================================
				4.11 - Strings
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Monsturtle
3	Karate Man
3	Akihiron
3	Barrel Rock
3	Kappa Avenger
3	Revival Jam
3	Humanoid Slime
3	Frog the Jam
3	Humanoid Worm Drake
3	Worm Drake
3	The Statue of Easter Island
3	Prisman

Magic:
------
2	Power of Kaishin

Traps:
------
2	Invisible Wire

Strings can use the multiplying abilities of his Revival Jams as tribute
fodder, so I advise using Thunder-Summon monsters to destroy them.  His non-
tribute monsters have 1500 ATK or less.  He specialises in using Water and
Earth monsters, so I suggest using Thunder and Wind monsters to destroy them.

===============================================================================
				4.12 - Umbra
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Nuvia the Wicked
3	Tao the Chanter
3	Morinphen
3	Togex
3	Blue-Eyes Silver Zombie
1	The Masked Beast
3	Mask of Darkness
3	Giant Germ
3	Shining Abyss
3	The Statue of Easter Island
3	Tripwire Beast
3	Masked Sorcerer

Magic:
------
1	Malevolent Nuzzler
2	Contract of Mask

Traps:
------
1	Bear Trap
1	Eatgaboon
1	Invisible Wire

Umbra uses varied Summons (Dark, Dream, Wind and Forest).  Most of them can
take advantage of the Yami field.  His non-tribute monsters have 1500 ATK or
less.

===============================================================================
				4.13 - Lumis
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Mystic Tomato
3	Stuffed Animal
3	Lisark
3	Masked Sorcerer
1	Masked Beast Des Gardius
3	Takuhee
3	Frenzied Panda
3	Grand Tiki Elder
3	Magical Ghost
3	Mushroom Man #2
3	Mask of Shine and Darkness
3	Melchid the Four-Face Beast

Magic:
------
1	Malevolent Nuzzler
2	Dark-Piercing Light

Traps:
------
1	Invisible Wire
2	Bear Trap

Like Umbra, Lumis uses varied Summons (Dark, Dream, Wind and Forest).  His non-
tribute monsters have 1500 ATK or less.  Half of them can take advantage of the
Yami field.

===============================================================================
				4.14 - Arkana
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Big Eye
3	Ancient Elf
3	Legion the Fiend Jester
3	Fairy's Gift
3	Mystic Clown
3	Witty Phantom
3	Doll of Demise
3	Dark Magician
3	The Stern Mystic

Magic:
------
3	Black Pendant
3	Book of Secret Arts
2	Beckon to Darkness
2	Yami
1	Monster Reborn

Traps:
------
2	Bear Trap

Arkana specialises in using Light and Dark-Summon monsters, so I advise using
Dark and Dream monsters to destroy them.  All of Arkana's monsters can take
advantage of the Yami field.  His non-tribute monsters have 1500 ATK or less.
He has 1 Monster Reborn and 2 Beckon to Darkness cards, so be ready.  He will
use his Equip Magic Cards to power up his monsters.  Fairy's Gift can increase
Arkana's Life Points by 1000.  His monsters are Fiend or Spellcaster-Type, so
you can use Exile of the Wicked and Last Day of Witch to clear the field of
them.  Your best bet is to change the playing field to benefit your own
monsters or use tribute monsters that benefit from the Yami field, such as Dark

Magician Girl and The Earl of Demise, to have easier time beating him.

===============================================================================
				4.15 - Bandit Keith
===============================================================================

(Deck info credited to datacrystal.romhacking.net)

Monsters:
---------
1	The Winged Dragon of Ra (Sphere Mode)
1	Metalzoa
1	Zera The Mant
1	Zoa
2	Barrel Dragon
1	Seiyaryu
1	Launcher Spider
2	Slot Machine
1	Machine King
1	Pendulum Machine
1	Space Megatron
1	Mechanicalchaser
2	Whiptail Crow
3	Ryu-Kishin Powered
3	Blast Sphere
2	Ryu-Kishin

Magic:
------
3	7 Completed
1	Brain Control
1	Change of Heart
1	Metalmorph
3	Machine Conversion Factory
1	Monster Reborn
1	Pot of Greed
2	Tremendous Fire

Traps:
------
3	Invisible Wire

Keith starts with 8,000 Life Points, and the playing field is the Yami type.
His non-tribute monsters have 1600 ATK or less.  Most of them are Fiend-Summon,
so you can use Light monsters to destroy them.  A lot of his monsters are
Machine-Type, so you can use Stain Storm to destroy them or play Umi to power
them down.

Keith's Fiend-Types can take advantage of the Yami field.  I advise summoning
tribute monsters that can benefit from the field, such as Dark Magician Girl
and The Earl of Demise, to have an easier time destroying them.

Keith will use Brain Control/Change of Heart to steal one of your monsters to
summon his Machine King.  It powers up if there are Machine-Type monsters on
the field.  If you can take it out, the rest of his monsters should be easy to
defeat with Dark Magician Girl/The Earl of Demise.  Keith will power up Slot
Machine with his 7 Completed cards if he gets an opportunity.  Barrel Dragon
can destroy up to 3 of your monsters with a 2-in-1 success rate.

If Keith summons The Winged Dragon of Ra, don't worry.  In its Sphere Mode, Ra
has only 0 ATK/DEF so even your weakest monster will be able to destroy it.
Keith also has a Zera the Mant in his deck.  If you're lucky, he won't get a
chance to summon it.

===============================================================================
				4.16 - Odion
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
1	Mystical Beast Serket
3	Talons of Shurilane
3	Embodiment of Apophis
1	Last Tusk Mammoth
1	Giant Rex
3	Keldo
3	Tri-Horned Dragon

Magic:
------
3	Swords of Revealing Light
2	Raigeki
1	Heavy Storm
1	Final Destiny
3	Monster Reborn
1	Dark Hole
1	Harpie's Feather Duster
1	Gravedigger Ghoul
1	The Inexperienced Spy
1	Beckon to Darkness
1	Restructer Revolution
1	Stop Defence

Traps:
------
1	Acid Trap Hole
1	Widespread Ruin
1	Torrential Tribute
1	Infinite Dismissal
1	Bear Trap
1	Amazon Archers
1	Anti-Raigeki
1	Invisible Wire
1	Dragon Capture Jar
1	House of Adhesive Tape
1	Eatgaboon
1	Goblin Fan
1	Bad Reaction to Simochi
1	Reverse Trap

Odion uses varied Summons.  His non-tribute monsters have 1800 ATK or less.
Like in the anime, his main deck theme is traps, but he also has a lot of
annoying magic and some strong monsters as support.

Odion's Dinosaur and Rock-Type monsters can take advantage of the Wasteland
field, so I advise changing the playing field to benefit your own monsters.
Giant Rex and Embodiment of Apophis are Odion's strongest non-tribute monsters.
Fortunately, Wind-Summon monsters can destroy them.

Odion has a wide variety of traps.  Anti-Raigeki and Torrential Tribute can
both destroy all your monsters if you set them off and Dragon Capture Jar can
stop Slifer the Sky Dragon from attacking.  Magic/trap destruction cards such
as Harpie's Feather Duster, Final Destiny and Heavy Storm are very useful in
this duel.

Odion will use his own card destruction as well, so watch out.  The time he
plays Final Destiny might actually help you, though, if you topdeck good cards
and he doesn't.

Odion has some tribute monsters in his deck, namely Talons of Shurilane, Tri-
Horned Dragon and Mystical Beast Serket.  If Mystical Beast Serket targets a
monster, that monster is removed from play, and this card receives a 500 ATK
bonus.

===============================================================================
			4.17 - Marik Ishtar
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
1	Cyber-Tech Alligator
1	Humanoid Worm Drake
3	Humanoid Slime
3	Worm Drake
3	Executor - Makyura
3	Revival Jam
3	Newdoria
3	Viser Des
2	Darkfire Soldier #1
1	Talons of Shurilane
1	Byser Shock
1	Des Volsgraph

Magic:
------
3	Swords of Revealing Light
3	Monster Reborn
2	Soul of the Pure
1	Harpie's Feather Duster
2	Raigeki
1	Pot of Greed
1	Spellbinding Circle

Traps:
------
3	Widespread Ruin

Like Odion, Marik uses varied Summons (Dark, Water, Thunder, Earth, Dream and
Fire).  His non-tribute monsters have 1700 ATK or less.  A lot of them are
Effect Monsters that can disrupt your dueling strategy.  He has based his deck
on the theme of Beatdown and Card Removal.

If Newdoria is in Marik's graveyard, it destroys one monster.  Viser Des can
power down one monster if it's on the field.  While Viser Des' ability doesn't
seem too bad, Marik can use it to weaken your monster indefinitely (permanently)
during each of his turns.  As long as Marik has 1 or more copies of Viser Des on
the field, he can decrease the ATK/DEF of your monster by 500+ points each turn.
Therefore, your monster can be weakened immensely, making even Marik's weakest
monsters stronger than it.  Fortunately, Exile of the Wicked can clear the field
of Newdoria and Viser Des.  Watch out for them, since Marik has 3 copies of the
cards in his deck.  Byser Shock can send your face-down cards back to your hand,
but Marik has to sacrifice 1 monster to summon it and he only has 1 copy of the
card.

Marik will use his Humanoid Slimes and Revival Jams as tribute fodder in order
to summon his strong tribute monsters.  Fortunately, Thunder-Summon monsters
can destroy them. You can also play Stop Defense to switch Humanoid Slime to
attack mode, so you can easily destroy it.

Executor - Makyura and Darkfire Soldier are Marik's strongest non-tribute
monsters.  Have a monster destruction card ready in case they are summoned.
Since Marik has a lot of annoying monsters and magic in his deck, he is one of
the hardest duelists in the game.  At least the playing field is the Arena
type, so his monsters can't get a power bonus.  Your best bet is to keep re-
trying until you get the right opening hand you need to take him down, i.e.
Slifer the Sky Dragon, Kuriboh, and Multiply.  If Marik gets a bad opening
hand, winning should be easier.

===============================================================================
			4.18 - Shimon Muran (Paradox)
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Guardian of the Throne Room
3	Keldo
3	Whiptail Crow
3	Reflect Bounder
3	Fire Kraken
3	High Tide Gyojin
3	Neo the Magic Swordsman
3	Battle Ox
3	Darkfire Soldier #1
1	Senenjin
1	Crab Turtle
1	Zera the Mant
1	Tri-Horned Dragon
3	Millennium Golem
1	Garma Sword
1	Cosmo Queen
1	Skull Knight

Magic:
------
1	Monster Reborn
1	Change of Heart

Traps:
------
1	Torrential Tribute

With the exception of Keldo, Shimon's monsters all have 1600 ATK or more.  He
uses varied Summons (Fire, Earth, Forest, Water, Fiend, Light and Dark).  Like
the Millennium Guardians, Shimon has a few strong Divine-Summon monsters.

Be wary of his Torrential Tribute card.  If Shimon places 1 card face-down in
his magic/trap zone, it is probably it.  Watch out for Reflect Bounder as well,
as he'll use its ability to take the ATK power of monster to cause Life Point
damage, very dangerous if he targets a God Card.

===============================================================================
				4.19 - Dark Mokuba
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
2	Gemini Elf
2	Witty Phantom
2	Man-Eating Treasure Chest
2	Darkfire Soldier #1
2	Skull Red Bird
2	Mechancialchaser
2	Dark Zebra
2	Yamata Dragon
1	Dragon Seeker
3	High Tide Goyjin
1	Talons of Shurilane
1	Aqua Dragon
1	Thunder Dragon
1	Dark Chimera
2	The Immortal of Thunder
1	B. Dragon Jungle King
1	Judge Man
1	Sky Dragon
1	Twin-Headed Fire Dragon

Magic:
------
2	Tremendous Fire
3	Swords of Revealing Light
2	Dragon Treasure
1	Gravedigger Ghoul

Traps:
------
2	Widespread Ruin

Mokuba uses a strong varied beatdown deck with high ATK monsters such as Dark
Zebra and Gemini Elf.  A lot of Mokuba's tribute monsters are Dragon-Type, so I
advise playing a Dragon Capture Jar to stop the dragons from attacking.

===============================================================================
			4.20 - Seto Kaiba
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Blue-Eyes White Dragon
1	Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon
1	Obelisk the Tormentor
3	Blade Knight
1	Invitation to a Dark Sleep
3	Vorse Raider
2	Des Feral Imp
3	X-Head Cannon
3	Y-Dragon Head
3	Z-Metal Tank
1	Ancient Lamp
1	Lord of Dragons
1	Steel Ogre Grotto #2
1	Swordstalker

Magic:
------
2	Crush Card
1	Heavy Storm
2	Shadow Spell
3	Dark Energy
3	Megamorph
2	Swords of Revealing Light

Like in the anime, Seto uses a strong beatdown deck with high ATK monsters such
as Vorse Raider and Blue-Eyes White Dragon.  With the exception of Invitation
to a Dark Sleep, Lord of Dragons and Ancient Lamp, his monsters all have 1500
ATK or more.  The playing field is the Arena type, so Seto's monsters can't get
a power bonus.

Blade Knight's ATK increases by 400 points if Seto only has 1 or no cards in
his hand, but he has a lot of tribute monsters that will probably clog up his
hand, so this monster's effect likely won't be triggered most of the time.

Invitation can immobilize your monsters.  This card can help Seto stall for
time until he can summon Obelisk the Tormentor or Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
Fortunately, he has to sacrifice 1 monster to summon it.

Beware of his X-Head Cannon, Y-Dragon Head and Z-Metal Tank cards.  If you
leave one of them on the field, Seto will have a chance to fuse the three cards
together.  Fortunately, you can use Stain Storm to destroy them or play Umi to
power them down.  Seto's strongest monsters are Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon and
Obelisk the Tormentor.  Seto won't have a chance to summon them if you can
prevent him from ever having 3 monsters to sacrifice.  If he does summon
Obelisk, he'll power it up with his Megamorph cards.  You can use your monster
destruction cards to get rid of Seto's Ultimate Dragon.

Ancient Lamp's special ability can provide enough monsters for Seto to
sacrifice, so be prepared.  Crush Card, Heavy Storm and Shadow Spell can turn
the tide in his favour.  Try to get Slifer the Sky Dragon onto the field, since
it's the only Egyptian God Card that is stronger than Seto's Ultimate Dragon.
Obelisk can destroy all your monsters and inflict 4000 LP worth of damage.
Fortunately, the ability has no effect on Ra.

Seto's XYZ monsters are strong even without being fused together.  However, if
they are fused together, the XYZ fusion monster won't be able to attack for 1
turn.  Also, since Seto fuses 2-3 XYZ monsters together to create the fusion
monster, it is summoned in face-up attack position and therefore can't activate
its ability.  Use this opportunity to destroy the fusion monster with Beckon to
Darkness/Crush Card.

2	Tremendous Fire
3	Harpie's Feather Duster
2	Change of Heart

Traps:
------
1	Torrential Tribute
1	Dragon Capture Jar

Sol has based his deck on the theme of Monster Control and Toons.  His non-
tribute monsters have 1600 ATK or less.  He is very tough because he uses
multiple copies of game-breaking restricted cards such as Thousand-Eyes
Restrict, Relinquished and Harpie's Feather Duster.  If that wasn't bad enough,
he starts with 20,000 LP.

Relinquished and Thousand-Eyes Restrict can both steal your own monsters.  If
they target a monster (including a face-down one), that monster is removed from
play, and they receive its parameters.  Unfortunately, you can't use Last Day
of Witch to destroy Relinquished and/or Thousand-Eyes Restrict, since Sol always
activates their abilities before you get a chance to do so.  Fortunately, their
effects can only be used once.  If you have no monsters on the field, Sol will
summon them in defence mode, so I suggest playing Stop Defence/Dark-Piercing
Light to switch the monsters from face-down to face-up position, thus
preventing him from using their abilities.

Sol has a few defensive monsters such as Dark Rabbit, Toon Alligator and Jigen
Bakudan.  Nearly half of his non-tribute monsters are Water-Summon, so a few
Thunder monsters should help.  They'll be good against any Water monsters that
he might steal from you anyway.  I advise changing the playing field to
Wasteland, Forest or Sogen, as those terrain won't benefit his monsters.

Red Archery Girl and Illusionist Faceless Mage can both immobilize your
monsters.  The former can also weaken them, so watch out.

Half of Sol's tribute monsters are Dragon-Type, so I advise placing a Dragon
Capture Jar on the field to stop them from attacking.  Toon Summoned Skull is
his strongest monster, since it can take advantage of the Yami field.  He only
has to sacrifice 1 monster to summon it, so have a monster destruction card
ready to destroy it.

Slifer the Sky Dragon is the most useful Egyptian God Card for this duel, since
it can decrease Sol's Life Points easily.  Just watch out for Dragon Capture
Jar, since it can stop Slifer from attacking.  Use a magic/trap destruction
card such as Harpie's Feather Duster, Final Destiny or Heavy Storm to destroy
it.  For beating this boss, you receive 1 DC (!) and 2000 Domino.

			4.22 - Reshef the Dark Being
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Vorse Raider
3	Mechanicalchaser
2	Zombyra the Dark
3	Nuvia the Wicked
3	Castle of Dark Illusions
3	Flash Assailant
1	Slifer the Sky Dragon
1	Obelisk the Tormentor
1	The Winged Dragon of Ra (Battle Mode)
1	King of Yamimakai

Magic:
------
3	Swords of Revealing Light
3	Pot of Greed
2	Harpie's Feather Duster
1	Monster Reborn
2	Megamorph
1	Raigeki
3	Change of Heart
1	Tremendous Fire

Traps:
------
3	Torrential Tribute

Reshef uses a very strong beatdown deck and is the hardest duelist in the game.
Like Sol, he uses multiple game-breaking restricted cards such as Castle of
Dark Illusions, Pot of Greed and Change of Heart.  He starts with 40,000 LP and
his non-tribute monsters have 1850 ATK or more.  His Fiend-Types can take
advantage of the Yami field.

Reshef has his own Egyptian God Cards, so you must prevent him from sacrificing
three monsters to summon them.  Reshef will usually play Swords of Revealing
Light to give himself enough turns to sacrifice three monsters.  He can also
steal your own monsters with his Change of Heart cards.

The Winged Dragon of Ra is the one God Card you should watch out for.  In its
Battle Mode, it can cut Reshef's LP to 1 and hit you with the LP amount he has
lost, so you will lose the duel in a flash.  If Reshef manages to summon
Obelisk the Tormentor and Castle of Dark Illusions at the same time, he'll
activate Obelisk's ability first and then he'll wait until his next turn to
activate it again when the Castle switches all of his cards to face-down
position.  This combo can easily turn the tide in his favour since you lose
4000 LP each time Obelisk's ability is activated.  If Reshef's LP is low and he
summons Slifer the Sky Dragon, you can use Reflect Bounder to target Slifer to
win the duel instantly.

Messenger of Peace can delay Reshef's actions and prevent him from sacrificing
monsters with 1500 ATK or more to summon his Egyptian God Cards.  Since you
probably have a lot of weak monsters in your deck, they won't be affected by
this and you'll be able to keep them on the field until you can summon your
stronger tribute monsters.  Make sure you discard Messenger of Peace
afterwards, though, to avoid losing any more LP.

Most of Reshef's non-tribute monsters are Dark-Summon, so using a few Dream
monsters against him should help.  A lot of them are also Fiend-Type, so you
can play Exile of the Wicked to destroy them.  If Reshef gets a bad opening
hand, winning should be easier.  For beating the Final Boss, you receive 3 DC
(!) and 2500 Domino.

1	Restructer Revolution
1	The Inexperienced Spy
1	Heavy Storm

Traps:
------
1	Fake Trap

Duke's non-tribute monsters have 700 ATK or less.  Be wary of Hourglass of
Life, as it can power up his monsters in exchange for 1,000 LP.

+~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
| Second Deck |
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~+

Monsters:
---------
3	Hourglass of Life
2	The Statue of Easter Island
1	Orgoth the Relentless

1	Raigeki
3	Soul of the Pure

Traps:
------
3	Invisible Wire

Aside from Gradius and The Statue of Easter Island, Duke's non-tribute monsters
have 700 ATK or less.  He will play Spellbinding Circle to power down your
monsters and use Equip Magic to make his stronger.  Darkness Approaches can
ensure the activation of Hourglass of Life's ability 3 times to power up his
monsters in exchange for 1,000 LP each time while Soul of the Pure maintains
his LP.  The Statue of Easter Island has a high DEF, so use Stop Defence to
switch it to attack mode.  You'll then have a chance to attack it.

===============================================================================
				5.02 - PaniK
===============================================================================

+~~~~~~~~~~~~+
| First Deck |

1	Black Pendant
1	Malevolent Nuzzler
3	Yami

Traps:
------
2	Eatgaboon

Aside from Mystical Lamp and Monster Eye, Panik's non-tribute monsters have
600-700 ATK and his Fiend-Types can take advantage of the Yami field.  He's
the first duelist who benefits from a field power bonus.  He specialises in
using Dark and Fiend-Summon monsters, so I advise using Dream and Light
monsters to destroy them.  Your best bet is to use tribute monsters that
benefit from the Yami field, such as Spirit of the Winds and Doll of Demise,
to have an easier time beating him.

+~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
| Second Deck |
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~+

Monsters:
---------
3	Dark Assailant

Magic:
------
2	Soul of the Pure
3	Swords of Revealing Light
2	Dark Energy
2	Tremendous Fire
3	Yami

Traps:
------
2	Invisible Wire

Aside from Castle of Dark Illusions, Panik's non-tribute monsters have 1100-
1150 ATK.  Panik specialises in using Dark, Fiend and Forest-Summon monsters.
Half of them are Fiend-Types, so they can take advantage of the Yami field, but
you can use Exile of the Wicked to destroy them.  Panik uses the same magic and
traps that the Chevaliers use.  He will use his Dark Energy cards to power up
his fiends.  If Panik has Castle of Dark Illusions and Reaper of the Cards are
on the field at the same time, he can activate Reaper's ability indefinitely,
so watch out.

				5.03 - Mimic of Doom

1	Mooyan Curry

Traps:
------
1	Bear Trap

Mimic's non-tribute monsters have 1200 ATK or less.  He uses varied Summons
(Dream, Forest, Fiend, Dark, Earth and Water).  Final Destiny might actually
help you if you topdeck good cards and he doesn't.

2	Megamorph
3	Swords of Revealing Light
3	Yami

Traps:

2	Invisible Wire

Mimic specialises in using Dream and Light monsters, so I advise using Fiend
and Dark monsters to destroy them. Half of them can take advantage of the Yami
field.  Mimic uses the same magic and traps that the Chevaliers use.  He will
use his Megamorph cards to power up his monsters.  Aside from Wall of Illusion,
Mimic's non-tribute monsters have 1200-1600 ATK.

Magic:

1	Megamorph
2	Cursebreaker
2	Magical Labyrinth

Traps:
------
2	Eatgaboon

Jeepers! Para has a couple of Jirai Gumo in his deck.  A non-tribute monster
with 2200 ATK is a big difficulty spike even by this game's standards, so have
a few monster destruction cards ready to destroy them.  Fortunately, his other
non-tribute monsters just have 1200 ATK or less, so they're a lot easier to
deal with.  Be wary of Sanga of the Thunder, Kazejin and Suijin.  They're
strong monsters in their own right and can fuse together to create the
formidable Gate Guardian.  Para also has another Gate Guardian in his deck.
If you're lucky, he won't get a chance to summon it.  Labyrinth Tank powers up
when Labyrinth Walls are on the field, but it shouldn't give you too much
trouble.

2	Cursebreaker
2	Magical Labyrinth

Aside from Para using stronger non-tribute monsters than before, his deck isn't
much different.  Your best bet is to use tribute monsters that benefit from the
Mountain field, such as Monstrous Bird and Parrot Dragon, to have an easier
time beating him.

3	Left Arm of the Forbidden One
3	Right Arm of the Forbidden One
3	Left Leg of the Forbidden One
3	Right Leg of the Forbidden One
3	Gear Golem the Moving Fortress
3	Wood Clown

Magic:
------
1	Pot of Greed

Rare Hunter uses an illegal Exodia deck based on the one he uses in the anime.
If he holds all 5 Exodia parts in his hand, he wins.  Fortunately, he isn't that
hard, as most of his monsters are defensive and he often plays his Exodia cards
rather than keeping them in his hand.  He can use Pot of Greed and Goddess of
Whim to draw another card or two, though, so try to beat him as soon as
possible.  If you spent too long dueling him, he might summon Exodia and win
the match.

+~~~~~~~~~~~~~+

3	Stone Statue of the Aztecs
3	Gear Golem the Moving Fortress
3	Hannibal Necromancer

Magic:
------
1	Pot of Greed

Rare Hunter's deck has improved slightly since your last encounter.  He now
uses Skelengel and half of his monsters are a bit stronger, but he's still not
that hard.

Bonz uses a Zombie-themed beatdown deck and his non-tribute monsters have 1600
ATK or less.  He specialises in using Fiend, Forest, Dream and Fire-Summon
monsters.  A lot of Bonz' monsters are Fiend-Summon, so I advise using Light
monsters to destroy them. Most of Bonz' monsters are zombies.  Eternal Rest is
perfect for clearing the field of them.

Bonz will use his field Magic Card to change the playing field to Wasteland to
benefit his Zombie-Type monsters.  Armored Zombie, Clown Zombie and Dragon
Zombie are Bonz' strongest 4-Star monsters, and they can take advantage of the
Wasteland field.  Fortunately, they are Fiend-Summon monsters, so you can use
Light monsters to destroy them.  The one monster to watch out for is Pumpking
the King of Ghosts.  It powers up Armored Zombie, Clown Zombie and Dragon
Zombie if they are on the field.

Rex uses a beatdown deck and his non-tribute monsters have 1600 ATK or less.
He specialises in using Earth, Wind and Fiend-Summon monsters.  Most of Rex's
monsters are Dinosaur or Dragon-Type.  I suggest placing a Dragon Capture Jar
on the field to prevent the dragons from attacking and using Flame Swordsman's
ability to destroy his dinosaurs.  Rex only has a few Wind monsters in his
deck, so you could use Wind and Light monsters to destroy his Earth and Fiend
monsters.  Rex's dinosaurs can take advantage of the Wasteland field, so I
advise changing the playing field to benefit your own monsters.

Weevil has based his deck on the theme of Beatdown and Insects.  He uses varied
Summons (Forest, Fire, Earth and Fiend).  He's the first duelist that ignores
the card restrictions.  His non-tribute monsters have 1500 ATK or less.
Weevil's insects can take advantage of the Forest field, but you can play
Eradicating Aerosol to destroy them.

Most of Weevil's monsters are Forest-Summon, so I advise using Fire monsters to
destroy them.  Insect Queen powers itself up for every Insect-Type monster on
the field, so try to keep the number of monsters on Weevil's side of the field
low.

The Petit Moth line are the insects to be ready for, as they will evolve into
their later stages of evolution at the start of each of Weevil's turns.  If you
leave them on the field for too long, you'll have to contend with formidable
monsters like Great Moth.

Be wary of Pinch Hopper, as Weevil can use its ability to summon an insect such
as Insect Queen and Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth from his hand without needing
sacrifices.  Weevil can also play Eradicating Aerosol to destroy one of your
monsters if Parasite Paracide has latched onto it.

Mako uses a strong beatdown deck.  His non-tribute monsters have 1800 ATK or
less and all of them can take advantage of the Umi field.  Fortunately, most
are Water-Summon, so you can use Thunder monsters to destroy them.  With the
exception of Kairy-Shin, all of Mako's monsters are Fish-Type.  Therefore, you
can play Eternal Drought to clear the field of them.

Fortress Whale is the most powerful monster in Mako's deck, since it is powered
up by the Umi field.  Ra's ATK/DEF is powered down to 2800 by Umi, so be
careful when using it in this duel, as Mako might use Equip Magic to make his
monsters stronger than it.  I advise changing the playing field to benefit your
own monsters.

Mai has based her deck on the theme of Beatdown and Winged Beasts.
Unfortunately, there are no specific monster destruction cards that can clear
the field of WingedBeast-Types.  Her non-tribute monsters have 1850 ATK or less
and most of them can take advantage of the Mountain field.  Fortunately, a lot
are Wind-Summon, so you can use Forest monsters to destroy them, but watch out
for Mai's Warrior-Types.  Warrior Elimination can clear the field of them,
though.  I advise changing the playing field to benefit your own monsters.

Mai can power up her Harpie Lady cards by using Cyber Shield and Electro-Whip.
If that wasn't bad enough, her Harpie's Pet Dragon can be powered up by every
Harpie-related card on the field.  Mai can use Amazon Archers to weaken Obelisk
and Ra so that her powered up Harpie's Pet Dragon can easily destroy them.  She
can use Elegant Egotist to transform a Harpie Lady into Harpie Lady Sisters.
Spirit of the Books can summon a Boo Koo to the field, but Boo Koo is a weak
monster, so you should be able to destroy it easily.

Espa uses a beatdown deck and his non-tribute monsters have 1800 ATK or less.
Fortunately, most of them can't take advantage of the Sogen field.  A lot are
Machine-Type, so you can use Stain Storm to destroy them or play Umi to power
them down, but watch out for his Warrior and Aqua-Types.

Reflect Bounder and Jinzo are the monsters to be wary of.  The former can take
the ATK power of a monster on your field to cause LP loss in return for its own
life.  This can result in you losing the duel if Espa targets Slifer the Sky
Dragon.  On the plus side, if he chooses one of your weak monsters, Reflect
Bounder will be destroyed for meagre LP damage and you'll have one less monster
to worry about.

Espa can also use Brain Control to steal one of your monsters for one turn.
He'll probably sacrifice it to summon The Fiend Megacyber, or he'll probably
attack with it.

Expert has based his deck on the theme of Beatdown and ATK/DEF Reduction.  With
the exception of Ancient Lamp, his non-tribute monsters have 1700-2000 ATK.
Most of them are Fiend or Spellcaster-Type, so you can use Exile of the Wicked
and Last Day of Witch to clear the field of them.

Castle of Dark Illusions is the monster to be wary of.  It turns the playing

field into the Yami type and also turns all Expert's monsters face-down.  With
the exception of Vorse Raider, all of his non-tribute monsters benefit from the
Yami field and he can activate Ancient Lamp's ability indefinitely, so be
ready.

Shadow Spell and Amazon Archers can both power down your monsters.  Since
Expert has 2 copies of the cards in his deck, he can decrease the ATK/DEF of Ra
and Obelisk immensely, making even his weakest monsters stronger than them.
Fortunately, Cursebreaker can negate the effects of Shadow Spell.

If you planning to use Slifer the Sky Dragon or Obelisk the Tormentor, try to
summon them before Expert plays Final Destiny.  Watch out for the Change of
Heart/Brain Control combo as well.

3	Torrential Tribute

Pegasus has based his deck on the theme of Monster Control and High Defence.
If he is unable to steal your monsters with his Change of Heart, Relinquished
and Thousand-Eyes Restrict cards, he will sacrifice the latter Divine monsters
to summon his strong tribute ones.  In addition, Pegasus can protect his Life
Points with the defensive Big Shield Gardna and Castle of Dark Illusions.

Relinquished and Thousand-Eyes Restrict can both steal your own monsters.  If
they target a monster (including a face-down one), that monster is removed from
play, and they receive its parameters.  Unfortunately, you can't use Last Day
of Witch to destroy Relinquished and/or Thousand-Eyes Restrict, since Pegasus
always activates their abilities before you get a chance to do so.  Fortunately,
their effects can only be used once.  If you have no monsters on the field,
Pegasus will summon them in defence mode, so I suggest playing Stop Defence/
Dark-Piercing Light to switch the monsters from face-down to face-up position,
thus preventing him from using their abilities.

Since Pegasus' deck is based on stealing monsters, you can trick him into
taking ones that are vulnerable to specific monster destruction cards.  For
example, if you let him steal Fiend-Type monsters (preferably weak ones), you
can use Exile of the Wicked to destroy them.  As an added bonus, this card will
also remove Castle of Dark Illusions and/or Toon Summoned Skull from the field.

If Pegasus doesn't have any monster control cards in his hand, he'll summon
Big Shield Gardna and Castle of Dark Illusions to protect his Life Points.  The
latter monster can change the playing field to the Yami type and switch all of
Pegasus' monsters to face-down position.  If Pegasus steals any Effect Monsters
from you, he'll use their special abilities against you, so watch out.

Seto has nearly the same monsters in his deck as before.  His non-tribute
monsters have 1500-1900 ATK, with the exception of Ancient Lamp and Lord of
Dragons.  Although the former and latter have only 900-1200 ATK, they can take
advantage of the Yami field.  In addition, Ancient Lamp can summon a La Jinn
the Mystical Genie of the Lamp, which has 1800 ATK and benefits from the field.

With the exception of Obelisk the Tormentor, Seto's tribute monsters are all
Dragon-Type.  Therefore, you can use a Dragon Capture Jar to stop the dragons
from attacking.  This can immobilize Des Volstgalph and prevent it from
destroying your strongest monster and inflicting 500 LP worth of damage.

3	Torrential Tribute

Joey uses a strong beatdown deck with high ATK monsters such as Boar Soldier
and Panther Warrior.  His non-tribute monsters have 1800 ATK or more.  Most of
them are Dark-Summon, so I suggest using Dream monsters to destroy them.
Alternatively, you can use Warrior Elimination to clear the field of them,
since they are Warrior-Type.

Gilford the Lightning and Jinzo are the monsters to be aware of.  The former
destroys all your monsters (excluding your Egyptian God Cards), while the
latter does the same to your traps, so be prepared.

Exarion Universe has the power to inflict LP loss identical to its ATK.
Zombyra the Dark can destroy one monster on your field.  On the plus side, both
monsters power down afterwards.

B. Skull Dragon has 3200 ATK and is Joey's strongest tribute monster.
Fortunately, he must sacrifice 3 monsters in order to summon it.  He rarely
plays it, as he prefers to summon one/two-tribute monsters.

3	Torrential Tribute
1	Destiny Board

One half of Bakura's non-tribute monsters have 2000 ATK and most of them can
take advantage of the Yami field.  The other half have 1200-1450 ATK or 2000
DEF and all of them benefit from the field.  His 4-Star 2000 ATK monsters are
all Dark-Summon, so I suggest using Dream monsters to destroy them.
Alternatively, you can use Exile of the Wicked to clear the field of them, with
the exception of Dark Elf.

Watch out for Dark Necrofear, as Bakura can power it up with his 3 Megamorph
cards.  This can make his monster's DEF Points greater than your monster's ATK
Points.  Dark Necrofear can steal one of your monsters (excluding your Egyptian
God Cards).  Fortunately, Bakura has to sacrifice 2 monsters in order to summon
it.

If destroying Bakura's strong monsters wasn't bad enough, you also have to
contend with his Destiny Board card.  It adds a letter at the start of his
turn.  Victory is automatic if the "FINAL" message is completed.  If Bakura
manages to play Destiny Board, try to avoid setting off his other traps.  That
way, he won't be able to play all the letters and his magic/trap zone will be
used up.

3	Swords of Revealing Light

Traps:
------
3	Torrential Tribute

With the exception of Big Shield Gardna, Yami's non-tribute monsters have 1500
ATK or more.  Flash Assailant and Dark Elf can take advantage of the Yami
field.  He specialises in using Light, Dark and Earth-Summon monsters.
Since the defensive Big Shield Gardna is the only Earth monster Yami has, you
could use Dark and Dream monsters to destroy his others.

Jack's Knight, King's Knight and Queen's Knight are the trio of monsters to be
aware of.  If you have watched the anime, you'll know that Yami usually uses
the above monsters as tribute fodder in order to summon his Egyptian God Card,
Slifer the Sky Dragon.  Queen's Knight is the weakest of the three Knights, so
concentrate on destroying her first to prevent Yami from getting Jack's Knight
onto the field.

If Yami manages to summon Slifer the Sky Dragon to the field, you'll have a
hard time taking it down.  Fortunately, Dragon Capture Jar can stop from
attacking as long as the Trap Card remains on the field.  If you can do this,
you can next try to summon Obelisk the Tormentor or The Winged Dragon of Ra
(Phoenix Mode) and use their special abilities to destroy the powerful Egyptian
God Card once and for all.  If you have Monster Reborn in your hand, you can
use to bring back Slifer under your control.

With the exception of Dark Flare Knight, Mirage Knight, Dark Magician Knight
and Slifer the Sky Dragon, all of Yami's tribute monsters receive a power bonus
from the Yami field.  Warrior Elimination can clear the field of Yami's
Warrior-Type monsters, most notably Dark Flare Knight and Mirage Knight, but
his Spellcaster-Type monsters can be harder to get rid of.  Fortunately, they
are vulnerable to Last Day of Witch's effect.

Dark Magician Girl and Dark Paladin can both power up, depending on the
monsters on the field and in the graveyard.  In addition, Yami can use Dark
Paladin's ability to destroy a magic on your field by discarding the far left
card in his hand.  Fortunately, Yami rarely plays this Effect Monster, since he
prefers to summon his signature Spellcaster-Type monsters.

Yami has a Dark Flare Knight in his deck.  It can be difficult to counter, but
he usually sacrifices a monster to summon it normally.  He only discards it if
he has 5 cards in his hand.  Once it's gone, it will summon a Mirage Knight to
the field.  Since Mirage Knight will split into a Dark Magician and a Flame
Swordsman, Yami will then have 2 strong monsters on his field to attack you
with.  Have a few monster destruction cards ready to destroy them.

Yami has another Mirage Knight as well.  Fortunately, he needs to sacrifice two
monsters to summon it.

			7.06 - Yami Marik

Traps:
------
3	Torrential Tribute

Marik has focused his deck on the theme of Card Removal and ATK/DEF Reduction.
With the exception of Viser Des, his non-tribute monsters have 1200-1800 ATK
and most of them can take advantage of the Yami field.  I advise changing the
playing field to benefit your own monsters.  Since a lot of his monsters are
Fiend-Type, you can use Exile of the Wicked to destroy them.

Marik has The Winged Dragon of Ra (Phoenix Mode) in his deck, but it's not as
bad as it sounds.  Ra isn't that tough to counter in this duel, since Marik
never discards Phoenix to the graveyard and always sacrifices three monsters to
summon it normally.  If Marik manages to summon Ra, I advise playing Umi to
weaken it a lot, so you'll have an easier time destroying it.  Once Ra's
Phoenix Mode is destroyed, its Battle Mode will be summoned immediately.  You
don't have to worry about Ra's Battle Mode effect, though, as Marik can't
activate it during your turn and Ra is changed to face-up position at the start
of his next turn.

If you have two monsters on the field, they might be sacrificed to summon
Marik's Lava Golem on your side of the field.  Although you now control this
monster, Marik can easily get it back by using Change of Heart.  In addition,
Dark Jeriod can destroy it via Summon advantage.  I advise discarding or
sacrificing it, since you lose 700 Life Points after every turn.

Marik's effect monsters - Newdoria, Dark Jeriod, Viser Des, Helpoemer and Byser
Shock - can turn the tide in his favour.  Like Viser Des, Dark Jeroid can power
down one monster, except that it can't decrease the ATK/DEF of your monster
indefinitely (permanently) each turn.  It does have a high enough ATK to be
able to destroy most non-tribute monsters, though.  Try to summon Mammoth
graveyard to even things out.

Be wary of Helpoemer if it's in Marik's graveyard, as it can force you to
discard 1 card (including your God Cards) if you have 3 or more cards in your
hand.  I advise using Gravedigger Ghoul to remove Helpoemer from the graveyard.
If Marik holds 5 cards and has Helpoemer in his hand, he might discard it, so
be ready.

3	Torrential Tribute
1	Anti-Raigeki

Noah uses a beatdown deck.  Fortunately, the Yami field will power down his
Fairy-Types.  His non-tribute monsters have 1700-2000 ATK.  Most of them are
Earth-Summon, so I suggest using Wind monsters to destroy them.

Giant Rex and Chiron the Mage are Noah's strongest non-tribute monsters, since
they aren't affected by the Yami field.  The latter monster can destroy your
strongest monster, so watch out.  Save your monster destruction cards until
they are summoned.

Noah has a variety of tribute monsters.  Berserk Dragon can attack all your
monsters once, but it powers down at the start of your next turn.  If you stall
for time, this monster will finish itself off eventually.  FGD can destroy
every card on your field.  Noah won't get a chance to summon it if you can
prevent him from sacrificing three monsters.  Have a monster destruction card
ready in case he does summon it.

Nightmare Penguin and Perfect Machine King can both power up, depending on the
monsters on the field.  The former powers up the aqua, fish, Sea Serpent, and
reptile types (including itself) on Noah's field, but since he doesn't have the
above monster types in his deck, Nightmare Penguin is weaker than his other
tribute monsters.  Perfect Machine King powers up two levels for every
Machine-Type monster on the field, so avoid having The Winged Dragon of Ra
(Battle Mode) face off against it.  Your Water-Summon monsters can destroy it.

3	Torrential Tribute
1	Anti-Raigeki

Shadi uses a very strong beatdown deck with high ATK monsters such as Flash
Assailant and Cosmo Queen.  All of his non-tribute monsters have 2000 ATK and
most of them can take advantage of the Yami field.  Half of them are
Spellcaster-Type, so I advise using Last Day of Witch to destroy them.  Half of
Shadi's tribute monsters are Divine-Summon.  Fortunately, Cosmo Queen and
Magician of Black Chaos are vulnerable to Last Day of Witch's effect.

===============================================================================
			7.09 - Shimon Muran (Paradox)
===============================================================================

Monsters:
---------
3	Boar Soldier
1	Cyber-Tech Alligator

3	Torrential Tribute
1	Anti-Raigeki

Like Shadi, Shimon uses a very strong beatdown deck.  He uses the same non-
tribute monsters, but his tribute ones are completely different.  Most of them
are still Divine-Summon, though.  Machine King and Cyber-Tech Alligator are
the tribute monsters to be wary of, since they are strong and require only 1
sacrifice to be summoned.  Fortunately, you can use Stain Storm to destroy them
or play Umi to power them down.

The monkeys' non-tribute monsters have 1200 ATK or less.  The monkeys'
BeastWarrior-Type and Warrior-Type monsters can take advantage of the Forest
field, so I advise changing the playing field to benefit your own monsters.
Nearly half of their monsters are Machine-Type, so you can use Stain Storm to
destroy them or play Umi to power them down.  Although the monkeys have the
same monsters, they use different Magic/Trap Cards.  Monkeys #1 and #3 use
monster destruction cards, such as Raigeki and Final Destiny. Monkey #2 uses
attack spells, such as Final Flame and Tremendous Fire.

2	Eatgaboon

The Guardian's monsters have 600-950 ATK.  He specialises in using
Dream and Light monsters.  I suggest using Fiend and Dark monsters to destroy
them.  He can use Goddess of Whim to draw a card, though it sacrifices itself
to do so.

Fiend-Type or Spellcaster-Type, so I advise using Exile of the Wicked or Last
Day of Witch to destroy them.

The Guardian's non-tribute monsters have 1000 ATK or less.  The monsters to be
aware of are Electric Lizard and Toad Master.  Electric Lizard's special
ability can prevent your monsters from attacking.  Toad Master's special
ability can help the Guardian gather enough monsters to summon his stronger
ones.

Magic:

3	Mountain
3	Restructer Revolution

The Guardians start with 3,000 Life Points, so I advise using Restructer
Revolution to help win these duels quicker.  Their monsters have 1500 ATK or
more.  They will use their field Magic Cards to change the playing field to
benefit their own monsters.

The Guardians also have a few strong Divine-Summon monsters in their decks.
If you're lucky, they won't get a chance to summon them.  They have no Trap
Cards in their decks, but they do have 3 Restructer Revolution cards.  Try to
decrease their Life Points to 0 as quickly as possible to avoid losing Life
Points due to the Magic Card's effect.  They will also use the Kuriboh/Multiply
combo to gather enough monsters to summon their stronger ones, so I advise
using Exile of the Wicked to destroy them.  In addition, they will place Equip
Magic Cards, such as Legendary Sword, face-down in the Magic/Trap Zone, but
they rarely have the correct monsters on the field to equip them to, thus
preventing them from powering up their monsters.
